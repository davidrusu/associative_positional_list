# Day 3 - SQLite3

[Link to problem](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3)

This solution discards efficiency in order to
use a totally unsuitable language.

I discovered in part 2 that SQLite lacks a PRODUCT() aggregate
function to accompany SUM; this forced the use of a rather nasty
trick to generate the multiply expression.

I also learned how to read input files in SQLite3. It has far more
options for import and export than I expected.
