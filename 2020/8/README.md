[Link to problem](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/8)

Visual Basic was the subject of derision from "real" programmers
throughout the 90s and possibly ever since, though it did also have 
a reputation as the easiest way to create a Windows application.
It has always been unknown territory to me.

Nowadays the classic version (VB6) has been deprecated and replaced
by Visual Basic .NET, which seems quite modern in terms of features.
Writing in this language does not really "feel" like writing BASIC,
at least any BASIC that I used 30 years ago. It is more like writing
in something like Python, with slightly more keywords and verbosity,
and a slight BASIC theme for some keywords ("Dim"). I didn't find
anything really weird, and the Visual Studio IDE was helpful with
its suggestions.
