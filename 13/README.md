[Link to problem](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/13)

D is a pleasant language to write and use. I can't help wishing for
an alternate universe in which C++ disappeared into obscurity,
since it is obviously possible to do so much better if the language
designer is willing to sacrifice some compatibility with C. The
absence of a C-like preprocessor is particularly welcome.

The second part of this problem was hard, and deliberately chosen
to be intractable if a naive algorithm was used. I did find a
solution which appears to be fast enough, without looking at spoilers.
But now it is solved, and I read more, I am not completely sure
that this solution will get the correct answer for all valid
inputs.
