[Link to problem](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5)

I had not used Powershell much before. It was nice to use it
for something beyond a small task. Writing these
programs was quite pleasant, much less awkward than Bash, with many
language features working in an intuitive way.

The main difficulty was finding useful documentation amongst a spam
of "tutorials" with higher search engine ranks. The
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about](Powershell reference)
was useful when I found it. 

I was afraid the second part would involve a new plane in which
the "binary space partitioning" actually mattered, which would force
a full rewrite, but luckily not.
