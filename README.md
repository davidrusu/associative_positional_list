The puzzles were released at 5am in my time zone, so I solved each
puzzle in a different language, rather than attempting to solve them
quickly.

I hoped to use the puzzles as an opportunity to develop better
skills and also try out obscure and/or vintage languages. In the end, I
did not do as much of this as I would have liked, finding a high
setup cost for many of the things I wanted to try.
