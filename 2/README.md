# Day 2 - i386 assembly code 

[Link to problem](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2)

I used scanf to read the inputs. This does the hardest part of
the job - parsing the string into integers, characters and
a "password".

The code is not very interesting. The program uses global variables
and there are no clever assembly code tricks. 

I learned that I still cannot remember the operand order for "cmp".
