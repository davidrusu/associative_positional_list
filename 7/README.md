[Link to problem](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7)

The problem description seemed to be saying "Prolog". We have a
series of rules about the direct relationships between objects, and
from these, we have to figure out indirect (transitive) relationships.

I didn't remember Prolog quite as well as I had hoped. The language
is unusual and lots of practice with "imperative" languages does
not transfer very well. It took a while to figure out how to describe
the problem and there were many false starts, where the interpreter
crashed with a stack overflow, or Prolog just said "no". However,
in the end, I reached a description of the problem which seems typically
compact.
